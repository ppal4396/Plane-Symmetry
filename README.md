# Plane-Symmetry
This python program creates plane symmetries after the user selects an image to create a fundamental domain from.

Packages required -

pillow https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html

tkinter (installs with python) https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html

math (inside python standard library)

numpy https://scipy.org/install.html

If you're using a version of Mac OS later than OS X, tkinter has serious bugs before python3.7.4. Install this version of python or later to successfully get tkinter working...

To run (after installing packages above), enter:
    'python3 symmetry.py'
from the command line.


###### Bugs

Text on buttons may not be showing correctly - I think this an issue with MacOS and might be fine on some OS versions or on Windows.
