# Plane-Symmetry
This python program creates plane symmetries after the user selects an image to create a fundamental domain from.
Packages required:
    pillow
    tkinter
    math
    numpy
    If you're using a version of Mac OS later than OS X, tkinter has serious bugs before python3.7.4. Install this version of python or later to run this program.
    
    To run, enter 'python3 symmetry.py' from the command line
